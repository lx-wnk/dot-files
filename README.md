# Dot files
A (Sometimes when I think about it) updated summary and script library for the setup of a mac.

It'll install most used programms for developers, add some configuration for `zsh` and other quality of life improvements

## What are dot files
> Dotfiles are configuration files for various programs, and they help those programs manage their functionality

What are they for me?
* (Base-) Configuration of my system
* Helper for needed programms to daily work with

## Contribution
You are free to fork, improve and optimize the current state. But keep in mind that this is for my personal use (so maybe add a few switches to prevent the installation of tools that not everyone needs).

Nevertheless, I would be grateful for contributions and feedback.
